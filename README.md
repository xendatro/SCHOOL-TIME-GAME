### Info
All programming and user interface was done by me with the exception of the open source modules listed below.
Open sources used:
- [loleris's ProfileService](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/) - Data saving wrapper
- [Sleitnick's CamerShake Module](https://github.com/Sleitnick/RbxCameraShaker) - Camera shake effect when enemy is chasing
- [Inventory System from DevForum] - The original poster has since removed this module from the forum. This is a wrapper around Roblox's backpack system
